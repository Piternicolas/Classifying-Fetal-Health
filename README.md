  * The health babies requires a higher care than others areas, we always need to search a new and different methods and ways that can bring a benefit to them, with the tecnology at the moment we have a chance to predict based on past data, babies who may some kind of disease right inside the belly throught tests, thinking about that in this article was created a Auto Machine Learning model using the library PyCaret to classify fetuses in 3 types, **0 → normal**, **1 → suspect** and **2 → pathological**. See more in google colab notebook attached to this article.
